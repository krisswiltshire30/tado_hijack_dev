<br>

**Built for the community — because Tado clearly isn't.**

</div>

<br>

---

<br>

Tado restricted their API? They think you shouldn't control your own heating? **Tado Hijack begs to differ.**

I engineered this integration with one goal: **To squeeze every drop of functionality out of Tado's cloud without triggering their rate limits.** We bridge the gap between Tado's restricted API and your smart home, unlocking features that Tado keeps hidden, all while treating every single API call like gold.

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking Change (Migration v6):**
> All polling intervals have been reset to their default values. This migration was necessary because the configuration schema switched from **hours to seconds** to allow for much higher precision and consistency across all features. Please review your settings in the integration options.

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> **Compatibility Note (Tado X / Matter):**
> This integration is currently optimized for **Tado V3+** (IB01) systems.
> **Tado X** devices use the new Matter architecture and a different API which is **not yet supported**. Support is planned for a future release; current focus is on perfecting the V3+ and HomeKit experience.

## The Hijack Philosophy

<br>

Tado's restricted REST API often forces a trade-off between frequent updates and staying within daily rate limits. **Tado Hijack takes a different path.**

Instead of just "polling less," we use **Deep Command Merging** and **HomeKit Injection** to make every single API call count. We don't replace your local HomeKit setup; we "hijack" it, injecting missing cloud power-features directly into the existing devices.

*   **💎 Zero Waste:** 10 commands across 10 rooms? Still only **1 API call**.
*   **⚖️ Weighted Intelligence:** Reinvests "Night-Savings" into High-Speed updates during the day.
*   **🌙 Economy Profile:** Automatically slows down or pauses during your sleep window.
*   **🎭 Pattern Obfuscation:** Uses **Multi-Level Jitter** (Poll & Call) to break the temporal correlation between HA triggers and API requests (Proxy only).
*   **🛡️ Thread-Safe:** Built-in **Race-Condition Protection** for hardware capabilities.
*   **📡 Transparency:** Real-time quota tracking directly from Tado's response headers.
*   **🛡️ Safety Floors:** Protects your account with enforced minimum intervals (45s/120s).
*   **🔗 No Redundancy:** HomeKit handles local climate; we handle the cloud secrets.

### The "Why" Factor

<br>

**Tado has gone full "Pay-to-Win".**

They've crippled the standard API to a pathetic **100 calls per day**, effectively taking your smart home hostage unless you pay for a subscription. We are currently in the transition phase where the original 5,000 calls are being steadily choked down to 100—a textbook example of **artificial scarcity**.

Tado Hijack is the definitive technical response to this hostility. I've engineered the **Auto API Quota** system specifically to handle this shrinking window, intelligently distributing your remaining "Gold" to ensure you never lose control.

*   **🛡️ Fighting Artificial Scarcity:** While Tado tries to force you into a subscription "toll booth," our **Deep Command Batching** and **Auto Quota** ensure you stay in total control, even as your limits vanish.
*   **⚡ Supercharged Resistance:** We stand on the shoulders of the Open Source community. Tado Hijack uses patched, high-efficiency libraries to maximize every single interaction.
*   **⚖️ Reclaim Your Hardware:** We refuse to play the subscription game. We squeeze maximum functionality out of the "Standard" tier, proving that superior engineering beats predatory throttling.
*   **📡 Quota Transparency:** Monitor your remaining "API Gold" in real-time. Know exactly when they try to silence your devices and stay one step ahead.

## Key Highlights

<br>

### Extreme Batching Technology

<br>

While other integrations waste your precious API quota for every tiny interaction, Tado Hijack features **Deep Command Merging**. We collect multiple actions and fuse them into a single, highly efficient bulk request.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Maximum Fusion Scenario:**
> Triggering a "Party Scene": **AC Living Room** (Temp + Fan + Swing) + **AC Kitchen** (Temp + Fan) + **Hot Water** (ON).
>
> ❌ **Standard Integrations:** 6-8 API calls (Half your hourly quota gone).
> ✅ **Tado Hijack:** **1 single API call** for everything.
>
> *Note: This works within your configurable **Debounce Window**. Every action is automatically fused.*

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Universal Batching:** This applies to manual dashboard interactions AND automated service calls (like `set_mode`). 10 changes at once? **Still only 1 API call.**

<br>

---

<br>

### The HomeKit "Missing Link"

<br>

**We don't replace HomeKit. We fix it.**
Almost no other integration does this: Tado Hijack automatically detects your existing HomeKit devices and **injects** the missing cloud-only power-features directly into them. You get the rock-solid local control of HomeKit combined with advanced cloud features in **one single unified device**.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hybrid Architecture:**
> This integration is designed to work **alongside** the native HomeKit Device integration.
> *   **HomeKit:** Provides the `climate` entity (Local Temperature Control & Current Temp).
> *   **Tado Hijack:** Provides the "Missing Links" (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings).
>
> *Note: Without HomeKit, regular heating valves will NOT have a climate entity.*

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **No Redundancy:** Tado Hijack does **not** provide temperature control for regular heating valves (TRVs), as HomeKit already handles this perfectly. We focus strictly on the features HomeKit cannot see: **Cloud-only controls** and logical Zone Schedules.

<br>

<br>

<br>

---

<br>

### Unleashed Features (Non-HomeKit)

<br>

We bring back the controls Tado "forgot" to give you:

*   **🚿 Professional Hot Water Platform:** Native `water_heater` entity with standardized `auto`, `heat`, and `off` modes. Full Pre-Validation ensures you never send invalid configurations.
*   **❄️ AC Pro Features:** Precise Fan Speed and Swing (Horizontal/Vertical) selection.
*   **📅 Schedule Transparency:** View the target temperature of your active Smart Schedule directly via the `auto_target_temperature` attribute while in `auto` mode (available for AC and Hot Water).
*   **🕵️‍♂️ Expert-Level Error Capturing:** No more generic "422" errors. Tado Hijack captures the actual response body from Tado's API (e.g. *"temperature must not be null"*), giving you and the community precise feedback for troubleshooting.
*   **❄️ AC Pro Features:** Precise Fan Speed and Swing (Horizontal/Vertical) selection.
*   **🔥 Valve Opening Insight:** View the percentage of how far your valves are open (updated during state polls).
*   **🔋 Real Battery Status:** Don't guess; see the actual health of every valve.
*   **🌡️ Temperature Offset:** Interactive calibration for your thermostats.
*   **✨ Dazzle Mode:** Control the display behavior of your V3+ hardware.
*   **🏠 Presence Lock:** Force Home/Away modes regardless of what Tado thinks.
*   **🔥 Dynamic Presence-Aware Overlay:** Set temperatures specifically for the current presence state — an exclusive feature that automatically resets once your home presence changes.
*   **🔓 Rate Limit Bypass:** Support for local [tado-api-proxy](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy).

<br>

---

<br>

### State Integrity & Robustness

<br>

Tado Hijack implements enterprise-grade state management to ensure your settings never get lost or overwritten:

*   **💾 State Memory:** AC fan speed, swing positions, and target temperatures survive Home Assistant restarts. No more "reset to default" frustration.
*   **🔒 Field Locking:** Prevents concurrent API calls from overwriting each other. Change fan speed, then swing, then temperature in rapid succession — all settings are preserved.
*   **🎯 Pending Command Tracking:** Drag a temperature slider? 20 UI events collapse into **1 API call** with the final value. Zero waste, zero duplicates.
*   **⏮️ Rollback on Error:** If an API call fails (e.g., invalid payload), the UI automatically reverts to the previous state with a clear error message. No "ghost states" where the UI lies about what's active.
*   **🧵 Thread-Safe Queue:** All write operations pass through a single serialized queue. Automations, dashboard changes, and service calls never conflict or race.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **tado-api-proxy TL;DR:**
> The proxy acts as a local cache and authentication handler. It allows you to use your integration without being strictly bound to Tado's cloud limits.
> 1. Run the [Docker Container](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy#docker-setup).
> 2. Set your `API Proxy URL` in Hijack Options (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8080`).
> 3. Enjoy unlimited local-like polling (safety floor still applies).

<br>

<br>

## API Consumption Strategy

<br>

Tado's API limits are restrictive. That's why Tado Hijack uses a **Zero-Waste Policy**:

### API Consumption Table

<br>

<br>

| Action | Cost | Frequency | Description | Detailed API Calls |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone Poll** | **1** | Adaptive | HVAC, Valve %, Humidity. | `GET /homes/{id}/zoneStates` |
| **Presence Poll** | **1** | 12h (Default) | Home/Away presence state. | `GET /homes/{id}/state` |
| **Hardware Sync** | **2+** | 24h (Default) | Syncs battery, firmware and device list. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices`<br>`GET /zones/{id}/capabilities` |
| **Refresh Zones** | **2** | On Demand | Updates zone/device metadata. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices` |
| **Refresh Offsets** | **N** | On Demand | Fetches all device offsets. | `GET /devices/{s}/temperatureOffset` (×N) |
| **Refresh Away** | **M** | On Demand | Fetches all zone away temps. | `GET /zones/{z}/awayConfiguration` (×M) |
| **Zone Overlay** | **1** | On Demand | **Fused:** All zone changes in 1 call. | `POST /homes/{id}/overlay` |
| **Home/Away** | **1** | On Demand | Force presence lock. | `PUT /homes/{id}/presenceLock` |

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Zero Waste Writes:**
> Unlike standard integrations, Tado Hijack does **not** trigger a costly poll after sending commands (except for Resume Schedule). We use **Local State Patching** to update the UI immediately without wasting a single API call on confirmation.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Throttled Mode:** When API quota runs low, the integration can automatically disable periodic polling to preserve remaining quota for your automations.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Granular Refresh Strategy:** To keep your quota green, hardware configurations (Offsets, Away Temperatures) are **never** fetched automatically. They remain empty until you manually trigger a specific refresh button or set a value.

<br>

### Auto API Quota & Economy Window

<br>

Tado Hijack doesn't just guess. It uses a **Weighted Predictive Consumption Model** to distribute your API calls precisely where they matter most — during your active hours.

*   **⚡ Predictive Cost Modeling:** It estimates the daily cost of scheduled background routines (Hardware Syncs, Presence, Offsets) and "locks" this quota to ensure system health.
*   **🌙 Smart Economy Profile:** Define an **Economy Window** (e.g., 23:00 - 07:00) where updates slow down (or stop entirely with Interval 0). The system automatically calculates the saved "API Gold" and reinvests it into your Performance Phase.
*   **🕒 Precision Sync:** It calculates the exact seconds remaining until the next API reset (**12:01 AM Berlin**) and adjusts your polling interval on-the-fly.
*   **📉 Weighted Budgeting:** Unlike linear models, we prioritize your awake-time.
*   **🔄 Dynamic Override:** When enabled, Auto API Quota **overrides** your manual *Status Polling* interval. Your manual setting only acts as a safety fallback if the system is throttled or the budget calculation fails.

<br>

**The Math behind the Intelligence:**

The system calculates your budget by subtracting scheduled background tasks and **external activity** from your daily limit, then applies a weighted distribution based on your economy schedule:

```
# EXTERNAL_EXCESS: Every call outside of Hijack's periodic background polling
# (Automations, Scripts, Manual App use) uses the Throttle Threshold allowance first.
# Only usage BEYOND the threshold reduces the polling budget for the rest of the day.
EXTERNAL_EXCESS = Max(0, Non_Polling_Calls_Today - Throttle_Threshold)

FREE_QUOTA = Daily_Limit - Background_Reserve - EXTERNAL_EXCESS
DAILY_TARGET_BUDGET = FREE_QUOTA * Auto_API_Quota_%

ECONOMY_RESERVE = (Economy_Hours / Economy_Interval) * Poll_Cost
AVAILABLE_PERFORMANCE_BUDGET = (DAILY_TARGET_BUDGET - ECONOMY_RESERVE)
```
<br>

**Adaptive Behavior & Safety:**

Instead of a static timer, your polling interval breathes with your quota and your life:

- **Performance Phase:** While you are awake, updates arrive as fast as every **45s** (or **120s** if using a proxy).
- **Economy Phase:** During your sleep window, the integration drops to a slow heartbeat (e.g., 1h) or pauses completely, saving every single call for the next morning.
- **🛡️ Safety Floor (Minimum Polling):** To protect your Tado account, we enforce a hard-coded minimum interval:
    - **Standard:** Minimum **45 seconds** per update.
    - **API Proxy:** Minimum **120 seconds** per update (to prevent account locks).
    - *Note: These limits apply even if your budget allows for faster updates.*

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Intelligence over Throttling:** While other integrations simply die when a limit is reached, Tado Hijack prioritizes **continuity over frequency**, gracefully slowing down to ensure your smart home stays informed 24/7 without ever hitting the hard wall.

<br>

<br>

### Batching Capability Matrix

Not all API calls are created equal. Tado Hijack optimizes everything, but physics (and the Tado API) sets limits.

<br>

| Action Type | Examples | Strategy | API Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Control** | Target Temp, Turn Off All, Resume Schedule, Hot Water Power, AC Fan | **FUSED** | **1 Call Total** (regardless of zone count) |
| **Global Mode** | Home/Away Presence | **DIRECT** | **1 Call** |
| **Zone Config** | Early Start, Open Window, Dazzle Mode | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Zone** (Sequentially executed) |
| **Device Config** | Child Lock, Temperature Offset | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Device** (Sequentially executed) |

<br>

> **Fused (True Batching):**
> Multiple actions across multiple zones are merged into a **single** API request.
> *Example: Turning off 10 rooms at once = **1 API Call**.*
>
> **Debounced (Rapid Update Protection):**
> Prevents spamming the API while dragging sliders. Only the final value is sent.
> *Example: Dragging a slider from 18°C to 22°C generates 20 intermediate events, but only **1 API Call** is sent.*

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not batch everything?**
> Tado does **not** provide bulk API endpoints for device configurations (Child Lock, Offset, Window Detection). We must send these commands individually per device. We optimize what we can, but we cannot invent endpoints that don't exist.

<br>

<br>

## Architecture

<br>

### Physical Device Mapping & Resolution

<br>

Unlike other integrations that group everything by "Zone", Tado Hijack maps entities to their **physical devices** (Valves/Thermostats).

*   **Matched via Serial Number:** Automatic injection into existing HomeKit devices.
*   **EntityResolver:** A specialized engine that deep-scans the Home Assistant registry to perfectly link HomeKit climate entities with Tado's cloud logical zones.
*   **No HomeKit?** We create dedicated devices containing **only** the cloud features (Battery, Offset, Child Lock, etc.), but **no** temperature control.

<br>

### Robustness & Security

<br>

*   **JIT Poll Planning:** Uses high-precision timestamps instead of simple flags to decide exactly when a data fetch is required (Zero-Waste).
*   **Monkey-Patching Utilities:** We actively fix `tadoasync` library limitations at runtime, including robust deserialization for tricky cloud states (like `nextTimeBlock` null errors).
*   **Custom Client Layer:** I extend the underlying library via inheritance to handle API communication reliably and fix common deserialization errors.
*   **Privacy by Design:** All standard logs and diagnostic reports are automatically redacted. Sensitive data is stripped before any output is generated. (See [Support & Diagnostics](#expert-level-diagnostics) for details).

<br>

## Installation

<br>

### Via HACS (Recommended)

<br>

1. Open **HACS** -> **Integrations** -> **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack` as **Integration**.
3. Search for **"Tado Hijack"** and download.
4. **Restart Home Assistant**.

<br>

---

<br>

## Configuration

<br>

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Status Polling** | `30m` | Base interval for room states. **Note:** Dynamically overridden by *Auto API Quota* when enabled; serves as fallback during throttling or budget exhaustion. |
| **Presence Polling** | `12h` | Interval for Home/Away state. High interval saves mass quota. (1 API call) |
| **Auto API Quota** | `80%` | Target X% of FREE quota. FREE = Daily Limit - Background Reserve (Scheduled Syncs) - User Excess. Uses a weighted profile to prioritize performance hours. |
| **Reduced Polling Active** | `Off` | Enable the time-based weighted polling profile. |
| **Reduced Polling Start** | `22:00` | Start time for the economy window (e.g. when you sleep). |
| **Reduced Polling End** | `07:00` | End time for the economy window. |
| **Reduced Polling Interval** | `3600s` | Polling interval during the economy window. Set to **0** to pause polling entirely. |
| **Hardware Sync** | `86400s` | Interval for battery, firmware and device metadata. Set to 0 for initial load only. |
| **Offset Update** | `0` (Off) | Interval for temperature offsets. Costs 1 API call per valve. |
| **Debounce Time** | `5s` | **Batching Window:** Fuses actions into single calls. |
| **Refresh After Resume** | `On` | Auto-refresh target temperature/state after resume schedule (HVAC AUTO). Required because schedules are Tado cloud-side. Uses 1s grace period to merge multiple resumes. Costs 1 API call. |
| **Throttle Threshold** | `20` | **External Protection Buffer:** Reserve N calls for everything outside of Hijack's periodic background polling (External Automations, Scripts, Manual App use). Polling stops when remaining quota hits this floor to ensure your automations never stall. |
| **Disable Polling When Throttled** | `Off` | Stop periodic polling entirely when throttled. |
| **API Proxy URL** | `None` | **Advanced:** URL of local `tado-api-proxy` workaround. |
| **Call Jitter** | `Off` | **Anti-Ban Protection:** Adds random delays before API calls to obfuscate automation patterns (Proxy only). |
| **Jitter Strength** | `10%` | The percentage of random variation applied to intervals and delays (Proxy only). |
| **Debug Logging** | `Off` | Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting. |

> **Intelligent Post-Action Polling (`refresh_after`):**
> When active, the integration uses a smart decision engine to save API quota:
> - **Immediate Refresh:** Triggered for `auto` (Resume Schedule) or permanent manual changes. Since the target state is reached immediately, an instant GET request confirms the cloud synchronization.
> - **Intelligently Deferred:** For timed modes (`duration`), the refresh is **deferred** until the timer actually expires. Polling immediately during a timer is wasteful; we wait for the "expiry event" to fetch the new post-timer state.
> - **Event-Aware:** For `next_block` or `presence` overlays, immediate polling is suppressed as the cloud state transition depends on external time/events.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Targeting Rooms:** You can use **any** entity that belongs to a room as the `entity_id`. This includes Tado Hijack switches or even your existing **HomeKit climate** entities (e.g. `climate.living_room`).

<br>

#### `set_mode` Examples (YAML)

<br>

**Hot Water Boost (30 Min):**
```yaml
service: tado_hijack.set_water_heater_mode
data:
  entity_id: water_heater.hot_water
  operation_mode: "heat"
  temperature: 55
  overlay: "manual"
  duration: 30
  refresh_after: false
```

<br>

**Quick Bathroom Heat (15 Min at 24°C):**
```yaml
service: tado_hijack.set_mode
data:
  entity_id: climate.bathroom
  hvac_mode: "heat"
  temperature: 24
  overlay: "manual"
  duration: 15
  refresh_after: false
```

<br>

**Manual Override (Indefinite):**
```yaml
service: tado_hijack.set_mode
data:
  entity_id: climate.living_room
  hvac_mode: "heat"
  temperature: 21
  overlay: "manual"
  refresh_after: false
```

<br>

**Resume Schedule (Auto):**
```yaml
service: tado_hijack.set_mode
data:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen
  hvac_mode: "auto"
  overlay: "manual" # Required by schema, ignored for 'auto'
  refresh_after: true
```

<br>

**Auto-Return to Schedule (Next Time Block):**
```yaml
service: tado_hijack.set_mode
data:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen
  hvac_mode: "heat"
  temperature: 22
  overlay: "next_block"
  refresh_after: false
```

## Known Constraints

<br>

**API Limitations (Tado Backend):**

<br>

While Tado Hijack optimizes every possible interaction, some operations are inherently limited by Tado's server-side architecture:

- **No Bulk Device Config:** Tado does **not** provide bulk API endpoints for hardware-specific settings. Temperature Offsets, Child Lock, and Window Detection must be sent individually (1 API call per device). If you change these for 10 devices, it will always cost 10 calls.
- **Schedule Logic is Cloud-Side:** When you "Resume Schedule", the actual target temperature is determined by Tado's servers. To show the correct value in HA immediately, a single confirmatory poll is required (if `Refresh After Resume` is enabled).
- **Sequential Execution:** To prevent account locks and respect the backend, device configuration commands are executed sequentially with a small delay.

<br>

**Hybrid Cloud Dependency:**

<br>

While Tado Hijack uses the cloud for its power-features, your basic smart home remains resilient:
- **Local Resilience:** Temperature control and heating state via **HomeKit** remain fully functional even during internet outages or Tado server issues.
- **Cloud-Only Features:** Access to Smart Schedules, Hot Water control, and AC-Pro features requires a connection to Tado's servers.
- **Why Cloud?** Tado does not expose a local API for advanced logic. Tado Hijack bridges this gap while keeping your local core intact.

## Troubleshooting

<br>

If you encounter issues, please check the following steps before opening a GitHub issue or asking on Discord.

### Expert-Level Diagnostics

<br>

Sharing diagnostics **should be safe**. Our built-in Diagnostic Report uses **Multi-Layer Anonymization** to protect your privacy while providing all necessary technical data. However, you should always verify the content yourself before posting it publicly. If in doubt, send the report via DM to an administrator.

*   **🔑 Key Pseudonymization:** Home Assistant Entity-IDs in JSON keys are transformed into unique anonymized hashes (e.g. `sensor.entity_8a3f`). This protects your room names while maintaining machine-readability for debugging.
*   **🛡️ PII Masking:** All sensitive names (Zones, Homes, Mobile Devices, Titles) are replaced with `"Anonymized Name"`.
*   **🕵️‍♂️ Serial Number Protection:** Every hardware identifier (VA, RU, IB, etc.), E-mail address, and cryptographic secret (Tokens, Hashes) is automatically masked via intelligent Regex everywhere in the document.
*   **📊 Pure Debug Power:** Despite maximum privacy, the report contains all technical insights needed for support:
    *   Detailed Quota & Adaptive Interval math.
    *   API Queue & Action status.
    *   Internal Entity Mappings (Anonymized but uniquely identifiable).
    *   Device Metadata (Firmware, Battery, Connection status).
