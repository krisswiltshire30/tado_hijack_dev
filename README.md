**The rebellion against API limits.**

Tado restricted their API? They think you shouldn't control your own heating? **Tado Hijack begs to differ.**

We engineered this integration with one goal: **To squeeze every drop of functionality out of Tado's cloud without triggering their rate limits.**

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 🧠 Smart Batching Technology
Most integrations struggle with Tado's strict quotas. Tado Hijack was built differently. We implemented advanced **Smart Batching** that intelligently merges your dashboard interactions into single, efficient API calls.

*   Click 10 rooms OFF in 1 second? That's **1 API call** for us.
*   Boost your entire house? **1 API call**.
*   Resume schedule for everyone? **1 API call**.

It's designed to give you back control.

### 🤝 The Ultimate HomeKit Companion
**We don't replace HomeKit. We supercharge it.**
Almost no other integration does this: Tado Hijack automatically detects your existing HomeKit devices and **injects** the missing features directly into them.
You get the rock-solid local control of HomeKit combined with the advanced cloud features of Tado (Battery, Offset, Child Lock) in **one single unified device**.
It's the best of both worlds.

### 🛠️ Missing Features Restored
HomeKit is great for local control, but it lacks deep system access. We add:
*   **🔋 Battery Status:** Real-time battery health for every valve.
*   **🌡️ Temperature Offset:** Monitor configured offsets.
*   **🔒 Child Lock:** Toggle child lock directly from HA.
*   **🏠 Presence Control:** Force Home/Away mode.
*   **🔥 Boost & Off:** Global controls to Boost or Turn Off the entire house.

## 📊 API Consumption Strategy

Tado limits API calls per day. Tado Hijack is engineered to stay well below the radar using our **1-Call Policy**: Every user action costs exactly **1 API call** (or even less with batching).

### API Consumption Table

| Action | Cost | Frequency | Description | Detailed API Calls |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Periodic Poll** | **2** | 30m (Default) | Fetches global state & zones. | `GET /homes/{id}/state`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/zoneStates` |
| **Battery Update** | **2** | 24h | Fetches device list & metadata. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices` |
| **Toggle Schedule** | **1** | On Demand | Switches single zone mode. | `DELETE /zones/{z}/overlay` |
| **Set Temperature** | **1** | On Demand | Sets manual overlay. | `PUT /zones/{z}/overlay` |
| **Turn Off ALL** | **1** | On Demand | Bulk OFF via Bulk API. | `POST /homes/{id}/overlay` |
| **Boost ALL** | **1** | On Demand | Bulk Boost via Bulk API. | `POST /homes/{id}/overlay` |
| **Resume ALL** | **1** | On Demand | Bulk Resume via Bulk API. | `DELETE /homes/{id}/overlay?rooms=...` |
| **Home/Away** | **1** | On Demand | Force presence lock. | `PUT /homes/{id}/presenceLock` |
| **Child Lock** | **1** | On Demand | Toggle child lock per device. | `PUT /devices/{s}/childLock` |
| **Offset Check** | **N** | Disabled | Fetches offset config. | `GET /devices/{s}/temperatureOffset` |

> [!TIP]
> **Throttled Mode:** When API quota runs low, the integration can automatically disable periodic polling to preserve remaining quota for your automations.

## 🛠️ Architecture

### Physical Device Mapping
Unlike other integrations that group everything by "Zone", Tado Hijack maps entities to their **physical devices** (Valves/Thermostats).
*   **If HomeKit is present:** Entities attach to the existing HomeKit device (Matched via Serial Number).
*   **If HomeKit is absent:** We create clean, dedicated devices for each valve (e.g., `tado Smart Radiator Thermostat VA12345678`).

### Robustness & Security
*   **Custom Client Layer:** We extend the underlying library via inheritance to handle API communication reliably and fix common deserialization errors.
*   **Privacy by Design:** All logs are automatically redacted. Sensitive data (User Codes, Serial Numbers, Home IDs) is stripped before writing to disk.
