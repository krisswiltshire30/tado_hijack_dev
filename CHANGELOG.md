## [2.0.0-dev.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.1.0...v2.0.0-dev.1) (2026-01-20)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** The integration now maps entities to physical devices instead of zones. Config flow and polling intervals have been updated.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): complete architecture overhaul and feature enhancement

- Migrated to inheritance model (TadoHijackClient)
- Implemented smart batching for API efficiency
- Added HomeKit device linking via serial number
- Added Child Lock and global Boost/Off controls
- Hardened logging security and PII redaction
- Removed redundant code and optimized polling
- Overhauled documentation and API table

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2026-01-17)

### ✨ New Features

* feat: add temperature offset sensors, throttled mode, and config improvements

FEATURES:
- Temperature offset sensor per device (1 API call per valve)
- Offset polling interval config (0 = disabled, only on manual poll)
- Throttled mode with configurable threshold
- API status sensor (connected/throttled/rate_limited)
- Manual poll and resume all schedules buttons with trailing debounce

FIXES:
- Options flow bug fixed (settings now persist correctly)
- Offset sensors now grouped under Zone device (like battery)
- Improved timeout message with API rate limit reset info (12:00 CET)

DOCS:
- Updated README with new features and per-valve API cost warning
- Clarified Matter is not supported (waiting for official HA Tado integration)
- Removed hardcoded rate limit references (varies month to month)

## 1.0.0 (2026-01-17)

### ✨ New Features

* feat: initial release of Tado Hijack

- API quota monitoring via passive header interception
- Home/Away presence control with debouncing
- Per-zone auto mode switches
- Battery health binary sensors
- Dual-track polling (fast hourly, slow daily)
- Monkey-patching for tadoasync null handling
- OAuth device flow authentication
- English and German translations
