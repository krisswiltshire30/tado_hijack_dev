### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Architectural overhaul with Hot Water and AC Pro support. Removal of legacy climate entities for hot water zones.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): Complete architectural overhaul with Hot Water, AC Pro, Zero-Waste optimization and robust state management

This major release represents a complete architectural transformation of the Tado Hijack integration, implementing production-grade features for hot water control, air conditioning management, intelligent API quota optimization, and bulletproof state handling. The update consolidates 12 development releases into a stable, thoroughly tested RC candidate.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔥 HOT WATER & AIR CONDITIONING (Native Support)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hot Water Entity:
- Native water_heater entity with ON/OFF/AUTO operation modes
- Temperature control with capability-based min/max detection
- Target temperature slider (hidden in AUTO mode for UX consistency)
- Auto Target Temperature: Introduced 'auto_target_temperature' attribute to provide visibility into the active schedule's setpoint while in AUTO mode
- Integer temperature steps (1.0°C minimum) aligned with Tado API constraints
- State Memory Mixin for persistent temperature restoration across HA restarts
- Boiler load monitoring sensor for energy tracking
- Optimistic state management preventing instant mode reversion

Air Conditioning Pro Features:
- Advanced climate entity with full HVAC mode support (COOL/HEAT/DRY/FAN/AUTO)
- Fan speed control (AUTO/HIGH/MIDDLE/LOW) with capability-driven options
- Vertical/Horizontal swing control via dedicated select entities
- AC Light control switch
- Physical mode preservation during AUTO mode operations
- Optimistic AC mode tracking to prevent stale state resets
- Mode-aware validation (FAN/DRY modes don't require temperature)
- Schedule Transparency: Added 'auto_target_temperature' attribute to see active schedule setpoints in AUTO mode

Climate Entity Hardening:
- Centralized TadoStateMemoryMixin for reliable state restoration
- Memory attributes with 'last_' prefix for visibility in state machine
- Robust temperature fallback chain (optimistic > current > capabilities > defaults)
- Activity parsing prioritizes state.setting.power for accurate HVAC action reporting
- Capability-based temperature support detection for Hot Water zones

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚡ ZERO-WASTE ARCHITECTURE (Extreme API Optimization)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Auto API Quota System:
- Adaptive polling based on daily quota consumption (configurable 50-95%)
- Real-time interval adjustment using remaining quota and time-until-reset
- Weighted interval calculation accounting for economy windows
- Automatic quota reset detection with scheduled refresh at midnight UTC
- Throttle protection with configurable threshold (pauses polling when quota low)
- Background cost reservation for offset/presence/slow polling
- Minimum interval enforcement (45s standard, 120s for proxy setups)

Extreme Batching & Command Merging:
- Bulk overlay API for multi-zone operations (boost/off/timer services)
- Intelligent command merger consolidates duplicate zone commands
- Debounced command queue (5s default) batches rapid user interactions
- Zone-level rollback contexts for failed command recovery
- Per-command-type field protection during pending operations

Polling Track Isolation:
- Independent fast/medium/slow/presence polling tracks
- Zone states: Fast track (scan_interval, default 30min)
- Presence: Configurable track (default 12h)
- Metadata (zones/devices): Slow track (default 24h)
- Temperature offsets: Medium track (on-demand + configurable interval)
- Away configurations: Lazy fetch on first access per session
- Capabilities: Cached on metadata fetch, lazy refresh on miss

Economy Window Logic:
- Time-based polling reduction (e.g., 0-polling during sleep hours)
- Dynamic interval switching when entering/exiting economy window
- Integration with Auto Quota for weighted cost distribution
- Configurable start/end times with cross-midnight support
- Switch entity to enable/disable reduced polling logic in real-time

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛡️ STATE INTEGRITY & CONCURRENCY (Toggle Revert Fixes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pre-API Validation:
- TadoOverlayValidator intercepts malformed payloads before API submission
- Zone-type-specific rules (HEATING/HOT_WATER/AIR_CONDITIONING)
- Temperature structure validation (checks for nested 'celsius' field)
- Mode-dependent validation (AC COOL/HEAT require temp, FAN/DRY don't)
- Enhanced error logging with full redacted payload details for forensics
- API quota preservation by catching 422 errors before transmission

Pending Command Tracking & Field Locking:
- TadoApiManager tracks in-flight command keys in thread-safe set
- Dynamic field protection based on command type (not hardcoded)
- Selective state merging: update sensors, protect overlay/setting fields
- Command-key-to-field mapping (zone_* protects overlay, presence protects presence)
- Data race prevention: polls skip protected fields until command completes
- Granular protection per zone (no global locks)

Optimistic State Management:
- Comprehensive OptimisticManager tracks overlay/power/temperature/mode/swing
- State clearing strategy: overlay=False clears all, overlay=True preserves existing
- TTL-based expiration (5s default) prevents stale optimistic values
- Rollback support on command failure with stored contexts
- Zone/Device/Home scope isolation for independent state tracking
- Swing and fan speed optimistic tracking for immediate UI feedback

State Patching & Restoration:
- patch_zone_overlay() creates rollback contexts before API calls
- patch_zone_resume() captures overlay state before schedule resume
- Centralized restoration architecture in TadoStateMemoryMixin
- Prevents data loss from failed API operations

CREDITS:
This release represents an intense week of architectural work, forensic debugging,
and real-world testing. Special thanks to @krisswiltshire30 for the collaboration
and to the community members who helped test and validate the hot water entity -
which turned out to be a massive pain in the ass to get right without physical
hardware. Your patience and detailed bug reports made this release possible.
