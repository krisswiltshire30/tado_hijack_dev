### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): major architectural overhaul, migration v6 and service standardization

This update implements a modular helper-based architecture, completes the v6 migration
and standardizes service interactions across all platforms while hardening the system against
common failures.

ARCHITECTURE & MODULARITY:
- EntityResolver: Centralized HomeKit/Hijack entity resolution logic into a dedicated helper.
- PropertyManager: Standardized hardware property updates via generic dispatchers.
- DiscoveryManager: Unified zone and device discovery loops.
- TadoEventHandler: Isolated HA event bus integration for optimistic triggers.
- Coordinator: Reduced bloat by ~40% by offloading business logic to specialized managers.

SERVICE STANDARDIZATION & VALIDATION:
- HVAC Mode Standard: Refactored 'set_mode' and 'set_mode_all_zones' to use standard 'hvac_mode' (off, heat, auto).
- Validation Matrix: Implemented central 'Pre-Validation' (DRY) to block invalid parameter combinations (e.g. heat without temp) before making API calls.
- Sensible Defaults: Established logic-aware defaults (heat mode @ 21C / 50C) and improved UI flow by making 'overlay' a required field.
- DRY Schema: Centralized parameter validation and YAML schema using anchors/aliases for maintainability.

STATE, DATA INTEGRITY & POLLING:
- Migration v6: Implemented mandatory reset of polling intervals to correct unit confusion.
- JIT Poll Planning: Replaced boolean flags with high-precision timestamps for plan-driven polling (Zero-Waste).
- Intelligent Polling: Implemented smart 'refresh_after' logic that suppresses redundant polls during active timers, deferred until expiry.
- Dynamic Optimistic Store: Implemented a maintenance-free key-value store for all optimistic states.
- Functional Helpers: Extracted state patching (state_patcher) and API payload construction (overlay_builder) into utility modules.

ROBUSTNESS & AUTH:
- Error Capturing: Enhanced TadoRequestHandler to capture and log actual API response bodies, providing detailed feedback for 422 errors.
- Auth Fix: Corrected token polling logic to prevent TadoConnectionError during initial OAuth device authorization.

- Technical Detail: Restored precise descriptions for Auto Quota math and Reset-Sync (12:01 AM Berlin).

## [4.0.0-dev.3](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.0.0-dev.2...v4.0.0-dev.3) (2026-01-29)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): consolidate next-gen zero-waste architecture and global timezone synchronization

ZERO WASTE & OPTIMISTIC STATE PATCHING:
- Implemented 'Zero Waste' principle where API write actions like overlays and resumes no longer trigger a confirmatory poll (async_refresh). Instead, the local coordinator state is patched optimistically immediately after the command is queued.
- Automated Rollback Contexts ensure that every command carries a snapshot of the previous state so that if the API call fails or the worker crashes, the local state is automatically reverted to ensure data integrity.
- Granular Patching logic includes specialized methods like _patch_zone_local and _patch_zone_resume to handle complex Tado state transitions (changing HVAC mode, temperature, and power simultaneously) locally in microseconds.

POLLING INTELLIGENCE & QUOTA MANAGEMENT:
- Weighted Quota Model dynamically calculates the polling interval using a hybrid model that reinvests API savings from the 'Economy Window' (night mode) into higher frequency polling during active hours.
- Economy Window Priority ensures that the reduced polling profile (e.g., 1h interval at night) now has absolute priority over auto-quota calculations, ensuring predictable behavior regardless of the remaining budget.
- Multi-Level Jitter is applied to prevent account bans at two levels when using a proxy: Batch-Level uses a base delay (1.0s) before processing command queues, and Call-Level uses additional randomized delays (0.5s) before sensitive calls.

GLOBAL TIMEZONE SYNCHRONIZATION:
- Global Reset Logic calculates the API Quota Reset using absolute 'Europe/Berlin' time (12:01 AM CET/CEST) via dt_util.get_time_zone, ensuring precise synchronization with Tado servers regardless of the Home Assistant local timezone.
- Local Economy Window conversely follows the user's LOCAL time (dt_util.now()), ensuring the heating drops when the user actually sleeps, not when it is night in Berlin.

HOT WATER & ZONES INTEGRATION:
- Full Platform Support includes a dedicated 'water_heater' platform with specific capabilities for Tado Hot Water zones.
- Unified Coordinator Logic integrates Hot Water control methods (async_set_hot_water_auto, _off, _heat) directly into the central coordinator, utilizing the same robust queueing and rollback mechanisms as heating zones.
- Intelligent Discovery by the 'device_linker' now correctly maps devices to both 'climate' and 'water_heater' entities based on zone capabilities.

AUTH-LAST CONFIG FLOW & PROXY BYPASS:
- Redesigned Config Flow follows an 'Auth-Last' strategy where configuration of Polling, Quota, and Advanced settings happens BEFORE authentication.
- Proxy Bypass allows users who provide an 'API Proxy URL' in the final step to skip the Tado Cloud OAuth flow entirely, creating the config entry immediately using the Proxy URL as a unique ID anchor.
- Unified Wizard ensures that both initial setup and options flow now share the exact same 4-step wizard logic (DRY), providing a consistent user experience.

CLEAN CODE & STABILITY:
- Technical Debt removal included removing all 'type: ignore' hacks, fixing all Mypy/Ruff issues, and restoring full type safety with missing constants and types in coordinator.py.
- UI Stability was improved by harmonizing TimeSelector usage to a standard format to prevent 'Unknown Error' crashes in Home Assistant Config Flows.
- Reliability enhancements include immediate persistence of 'Reduced Polling Logic' switch states to the config entry and an automated Migration v6 that converts old hour-based intervals to seconds.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** The migration to advanced presence polling changes internal track
handling. Config entry versions have been bumped to ensure clean state hydration.

Co-authored-by: krisswiltshire30 <kriss.wiltshire@googlemail.com>

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): implement advanced presence polling, adaptive quota and expert-level diagnostics

This massive update stabilizes the core architecture for highly restricted API environments
and introduces a military-grade privacy layer for diagnostic reporting.

CORE ARCHITECTURE:
- Presence Polling Evolution: Replaced legacy polling with advanced tracks using sequential
  state handling to minimize race conditions and API overhead.
- Adaptive Quota Brain: Implemented stateless, predictive quota calculation. The system
  now intelligently adjusts polling intervals based on remaining 'API Gold' and daily reset
  targets (12:01 Berlin).
- Safety Thresholds: Integrated a dynamic buffer that prioritizes manual user actions and
  automations over periodic background polling when quota is low.

PLATFORM STABILIZATION:
- Hot Water Restoration: Fully restored the water_heater platform. Fixed temperature
  reporting (None for non-temp hardware) and optimized service selectors for environment
  independence.
- Sensor Noise Reduction: Eliminated excessive debug logging in valve state updates.

EXPERT-LEVEL DIAGNOSTICS & PRIVACY:
- Multi-Layer Anonymization: Diagnostic reports are now safe for public support.
- Key Pseudonymization: HA Entity-IDs in JSON keys are transformed into unique hashes
  (e.g., entity_8a3f), protecting room names while maintaining machine-readability.
- Global PII Masking: Hard redaction for serials (VA, RU, IB), emails, geo-coordinates,
  and cryptographic secrets (Tokens, Hashes, Salts) via intelligent Regex.
- Contextual Redaction: Automatically identifies and replaces sensitive fields from
  all tadoasync models (username, firstname, mobile_number, etc.).

DOCUMENTATION:
- Fully updated README covering the new consumption strategy, architecture highlights,
  and the experts-only diagnostics system.
- Cleaned up all internal 'v4' references to maintain public release consistency.
