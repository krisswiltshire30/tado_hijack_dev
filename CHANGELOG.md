## [3.1.0-dev.5](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v3.1.0-dev.4...v3.1.0-dev.5) (2026-01-23)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(quota): add Auto API Quota with adaptive polling

Automatically distribute API calls throughout the day based on a
configurable percentage of available quota. The system dynamically
adjusts polling intervals to maximize freshness while respecting limits.

Key changes:

- Auto API Quota setting (0-100%) in config flow
  Calculates FREE quota = Limit - Throttle - Battery - Offset updates
  Distributes X% evenly until 12:05 CET reset

- Adaptive interval calculation
  Uses real poll cost measurement instead of hardcoded values
  Respects throttle threshold - stops polling when quota low
  Auto-adjusts based on remaining quota and time until reset

- Scheduled reset poll at 12:05 CET
  Fetches fresh quota data right after daily reset
  Ensures accurate calculations for the new day

- Hot Water zone resolution fix
  Parse zone_{id}_suffix format correctly (e.g. zone_5_target_temp)

- Config flow UX improvements
  Reorder options: Fast Poll → Auto Quota → Battery → Offset → etc.
  Move advanced options (Proxy, Debug) to bottom

- README overhaul
  Add Auto API Quota section with calculation example
  Convert services list to table format
  Fix German text, update API consumption table
  General formatting and spacing improvements

- Prevent duplicate patch application
  Add idempotent guard to apply_patch()

Technical notes:
- PollTask abstraction for cost tracking
- _build_poll_plan() as single source of truth
- estimate_daily_reserved_cost() for budget planning
- Europe/Berlin timezone for CET reset calculation
